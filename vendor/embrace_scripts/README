===========
This package is based on the ideas developed for the EMBRACE Registry for 
functional testing of web services. This has been written for BioCatalogue
to improve portability.

Notes
============

These notes are mainly intended for anyone setting up monitoring with
test scripts for their own BioCatalogue instance.


This package can be checked out from the BioCatalogue repository
into an area when it can execute semi-independently. It is however
required that the machine running the scripts has access to the 
BioCatalogue instance database in order to import the scripts.

Before running the harness, you need to setup the configuration file.
There is a sample file in the config directory with notes to help you set it 
up for your instance. This file is called "tests_script_runner.config.pre". 
Copy this file into "tests_script_runner.config" and modify it accordingly.

After creating this configuration file, you are now ready to setup the
environment for running the test scripts. Run the scripts indicated below
in order (from src dir):

1) Setup the run directories by running:
	
	python make_rundirs.py
	
	This will import the scripts from the database into your execution directory
	creating a sub directory for each test. The pattern for the sub-directory names
	are <service_id>/<test_id>. It will also de-compress any zip archives.

2) Create a listing of the scripts in the from the database by running:
	
	python script_listing_writer.py
	
	This will create a file in config directory called "script_listing.xml"
	
	NOTE: 
	====
	This is created from the BioCatalogue instance database so will contain all
	the tests available in the db. It is advisable to configure only a small number
	of test while setting up initially. This can be achieve by commenting out some 
	tests in the "script_listing.xml" xml file
	
3) Now run the harness script. This should be run with the option to get the tests to run from the 
   xml file created in 2). This is achieved by running
   
   python biocat_harness.py --fromFile=../config/script_listing.xml ../config/tests_script_runner.config
   
   This will run the tests and post the results to your BioCatalogue instance. If all goes well, you will
   see the statuses of the configured tests updated in your BioCatalogue instance.
   
Each of the tests has a job execution directory as created in 1). If you find any doubtful test status posted,
you should check in these directories for the job log files.

Thanks for using the BioCatalogue TestHarness.
