Dear BioCatalogue Member,
<p />

We have noticed that the status of your test <%= @test_script.name %> has changed. 
Would be nice if you could check by going to the parent service 
<br />

<%= link_to "Test script status changed",
            :only_path => false,
            :host => @base_url,
            :controller => 'services',
            :action => 'show',
            :id => @test_script.testable_id %>
			
<p />

If you have any questions please reply to this mail.

<p />

Regards <br />

The BioCatalogue Team
