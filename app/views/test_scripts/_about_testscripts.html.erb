		<b>About Test Scripts</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Test scripts are simple clients to web services which can be uploaded to the BioCatalogue. 
		The aims of the test scripts are to provide the users with sample clients of how to use the service
		and also to enable the BioCatalogue system to monitor the status of the services by running these sample clients regularly. <br />
		
		Allowed test scripts are those written in python, perl or ruby. Also <%= link_to 'soapUI', 'http://www.soapui.org/'-%>  test suites
		(xml project files) can be submitted.
